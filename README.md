# Tank-Assault-Arcade-Game

-This was the first game I created using Python Turtle Graphics.

-I was still learning python at the time, and I was still introducing myself to game development. 

-You are a tank deployed on an alien-infested planet. Defend the planet from the enemy aliens.

-Space to shoot cannon, A and D to rotate the cannon left and right.
